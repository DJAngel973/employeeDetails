# Employee Management System (Basic JavaScript)
## Project Description
This project is a simple web application developed to practice fundamental JavaScript and HTML concepts. It simulates an employee management system that allows users to:

View a complete list of all employees.

Calculate and display the total of all salaries.

Filter employees by department (for example, the Human Resources department).

Find a specific employee by their ID.

Filter employees by specialization (for example, 'JavaScript').

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of the following topics:

Manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model) to interact with the webpage.

Usage of JavaScript array methods such as `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`.

Function creation and event handling.

Conditional logic to handle different search results.

## Technologies Used
HTML5: For the page structure.

JavaScript ES6+: For the application logic.

## How to Use It
To run this project, you only need a web browser.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

Use the buttons on the interface to interact with the employee management system.
